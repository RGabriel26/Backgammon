ðŸŽ² Welcome to my first significant Python project! I've delved into the world of PyQt6 to create a simple yet engaging backgammon game.

ðŸš§ The project is about 80% complete, but it's the final touches that truly make it shine. Here's what's left on my to-do list:

Implementing Turn Rotation: When players exhaust all possible moves with their current dice roll, it's vital to switch turns to the player who has the right of action. This keeps the game flowing smoothly and ensures fairness.

Visualizing All Possible Moves: I aim to enhance user experience by making all potential moves visible, highlighting positions where players can utilize their available dice. This feature adds clarity and excitement to the gameplay.

Determining the First Player: Every game needs to start somewhere! I'll be adding a system to determine the starting player, setting the stage for an epic backgammon showdown.

Squashing Minor Bugs: While the game is already enjoyable, there are a few pesky bugs that need fixing. Nothing major, just minor tweaks to ensure a seamless gaming experience.

With these final touches, my backgammon game will be ready to delight players with its smooth gameplay and polished interface. Let's roll the dice and make this project a winner! ðŸŽ²âœ¨

ðŸŽ¥ Check out this explanatory video showcasing the gameplay of my backgammon project!

In this video, I'll walk you through the features and mechanics of the game, demonstrating how players can strategize, roll the dice, and make their moves on the board.

With clear explanations and engaging visuals, you'll quickly grasp the rules and dynamics of backgammon, whether you're a seasoned player or new to the game.
